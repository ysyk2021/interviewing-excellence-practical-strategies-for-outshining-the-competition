Do Your Research

Before entering into salary and benefits negotiations, it's important to do your research to understand the market rates for your position and industry. Here are some resources for conducting research:

When negotiating benefits and perks, it's important to prioritize your needs and identify which items are most important to you. Here are some common benefits and perks to consider:

* **Health insurance**: Health insurance is often one of the most important benefits for employees to consider.
* **Vacation time**: Consider how much vacation time you need to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

It's important to know the company's policies regarding salary and benefits before negotiating. Here are some things to consider:
