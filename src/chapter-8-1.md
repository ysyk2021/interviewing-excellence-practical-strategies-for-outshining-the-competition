Phone and video interviews have become increasingly common in today's hiring process, especially for initial screenings. This chapter explores strategies and tips for excelling in these remote interview formats.

### **1. Technical Preparedness**

Technical issues can disrupt your interview. Ensure you're prepared:

* **Test Equipment:** Check your phone, computer, camera, and microphone in advance.
* **Internet Connection:** Ensure a stable and high-speed internet connection.
* **Quiet Environment:** Find a quiet and well-lit space for the interview.

### **2. Dress Professionally**

Even in a remote setting, dressing professionally is important:

* **Appropriate Attire:** Dress as you would for an in-person interview to convey professionalism.
* **Avoid Distractions:** Minimize distracting jewelry or overly busy patterns.

### **3. Maintain Eye Contact**

In video interviews, maintain eye contact with the camera, not the screen:

* **Engage Nonverbal Cues:** Convey interest and attentiveness through facial expressions and body language.
* **Limit Distractions:** Close unnecessary tabs or applications on your computer.

### **4. Practice Answers Aloud**

Practice your responses aloud before the interview:

* **Clarity and Confidence:** Speaking your answers helps with clarity and confidence.
* **Avoid Reading:** However, avoid reading responses verbatim during the interview.

### **5. Have Materials Ready**

Keep essential materials nearby:

* **Resume and Notes:** Have a copy of your resume and any notes or talking points.
* **Job Description:** Keep the job description handy for reference.

### **6. Mind Your Tone and Pace**

In phone interviews, tone and pace are crucial:

* **Friendly Tone:** Maintain a friendly and enthusiastic tone in your voice.
* **Speak Clearly:** Enunciate your words and avoid speaking too fast.

### **7. Practice Video Etiquette**

Video interviews have their own etiquette:

* **Test Camera Angles:** Make sure your camera is at eye level and provides a clear view of your face.
* **Background:** Choose a professional and uncluttered background.

### **8. Virtual Handshake and Smile**

Begin with a virtual handshake and a smile:

* **Greeting:** Start with a warm greeting and a virtual handshake if the opportunity arises.
* **Smile:** Smile genuinely to convey enthusiasm and friendliness.

### **9. Active Listening**

Demonstrate active listening:

* **Nod and Acknowledge:** Nod occasionally to show you're engaged, and use verbal cues like "I see" or "That makes sense."

### **10. Follow-Up Promptly**

After phone or video interviews, send a thank-you email promptly:

* **Appreciation:** Express gratitude for the opportunity to interview and reiterate your interest in the role.
* **Recap Key Points:** Summarize key points discussed during the interview.
